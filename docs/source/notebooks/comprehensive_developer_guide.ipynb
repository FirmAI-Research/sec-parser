    "Welcome to the Comprehensive Developer Guide for `sec-parser`. This guide is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the `sec-parser` project, whether you're a new developer looking to contribute, or an experienced one seeking to leverage its capabilities. We'll walk you through the codebase, explaining key components and their interactions, and provide examples to help you get started. \n",
