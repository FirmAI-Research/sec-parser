    "Welcome to the Comprehensive Developer Guide for `sec-parser`. This guide is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the `sec-parser` project, whether you're a new developer looking to contribute, or an experienced one seeking to leverage its capabilities. We'll walk you through the codebase, explaining key components and their interactions, and provide examples to help you get started. \n",

    "This guide is interactive, allowing you to engage with the code and concepts as you learn. You can run and modify all the code examples shown here for yourself by cloning the repository and running the [comprehensive_developer_guide.ipynb](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec-parser/blob/main/docs/source/notebooks/comprehensive_developer_guide.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
